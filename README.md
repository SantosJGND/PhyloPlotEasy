# PhyloPlot Easy

PhyloPlot is a set of Python-based applications designed to visualize phylogenetic trees with metadata. It allows users to select metadata and Newick files, choose columns for markers and highlights, and generate annotated phylogenetic tree plots using an integrated R script.

This repository contains two applications:

- [phyloplot-gui](phyloplot-gui): A graphical user interface (GUI) application for generating phylogenetic tree plots.
- [phyloplot-app](phyloplot-app): A web application (Flask or Streamlit) for generating phylogenetic tree plots.
